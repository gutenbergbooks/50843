<p class="drop-cap-simple">"Paint an angel!" exclaimed Courbet (koor-bay´) the realist to a
pupil who one day asked him how it should be done. "When did you
ever see an angel?" The abashed pupil had to admit that he had
never had the good fortune to see one. "Very well, then, you had better
paint the portrait of your grandfather, whom you see every day." The
advice to keep his head out of the clouds while his feet were on earth
may have been needed by the pupil; but nevertheless angels have been
painted time out of mind, and even such pronounced realists as Courbet
and Manet (mah-nay´) have painted them. And they saw them, too;
that is, they saw the pretty-faced models they turned into angels by adding
enlarged pigeon wings to their shoulder blades. But they were not
very spiritual angels. Realism rather scorns things spiritual, and besides
religious feeling and sentiment in art passed out several centuries before
the coming of the modern realists.</p>

<p>The early men&mdash;the Fra Angelicos, the Benozzos (ben-ots-o), the
Filippinos, of the fifteenth century&mdash;believed in the Biblical scenes they
painted, and sometimes stated their belief in letters of gold at the bottom
of their pictures. They saw things with the eye of faith,&mdash;saw Madonnas,
saints, and angels in visions, and painted them, as the evangelists wrote,
by the aid of inspiration. Perhaps it was their belief, their intense feeling,
that gave the fine religious sentiment to the work of these early men.
Yet they did not invent or discover the angel in art. It had a more mate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>rial
and commonplace origin than in
medieval belief and religious fervor.</p>


<h3 class="gesperrt">WINGED FIGURES IN
ANCIENT ART</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus02a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PERUGINO: BAPTISM OF CHRIST (detail)</p>
</div>

<p>There were winged figures in
Egyptian, Chaldean, and Assyrian art,
deities of the air, goddesses of the
cloud and the heavens. The Hittite
and the Persian produced the winged
Sphinx, and the Greek the winged
Victory that flew above the advancing
host and pointed the way to glory.
This winged Victory of the Greeks
probably suggested the Christian angel;
though the immediate forerunner of the angel was found in the Cupid
and Psyche of Roman art. The Christians, following the Romans, took
over in their art much of the material of the old Roman world. They
had to do this; for Christianity was without form in art, and the early
Christians decried it as idolatrous. But later on there came a demand for
telling the Bible stories in form and color, that people might see what they
could not read. Then Christianity, answering the demand, took up
Roman forms and gave them Christian significance. They took the
Cupids of Roman art and turned them into Cherubs, and out of the
winged Victories and Psyches they made ministering angels.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/illus02b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PERUGINO: CHERUB HEAD (detail)</p>
</div>

<p>The pagan form was soon forgotten in the Christian spirit, and
the angels of the Gothic and early Renaissance periods developed
a new meaning, a new soul. What beautiful sentiment, what profound
feeling, the early painters put into the angel of the Annunciation!
What a world of pathos and sadness they gave the angel
seated by the tomb of Christ! What gladness and joy to the angels
of the Nativity standing near the Madonna or singing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria
in Excelsis</i> in the upper sky! According to tradition, the angels
know neither gladness nor sadness, neither wrath
nor pity. They are heavenly messengers obeying
the mandates of the Most High, without emotion
or feeling of any kind. But the old masters of Italy
did not so regard them. They gave them human
characteristics, made them emotional and sympathetic,
painted them in robes of blue, of red, of gold,
of white, and gave them faces and forms that
were human, it is true, but as near divine as
earthly thought could render them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gesperrt">CHERUBIM AND SERAPHIM</h3>

<p>The red-robed angels (they were painted red of face as well as of
robe) were the Seraphim, the angels of love, and nearest to God. Often
with the early painters only their heads were shown, with wings crossed
in front of them, sometimes with four, six, or eight wings. The blue-robed
angels were the Cherubim, the angels of knowledge, and they too
were shown in their heads only, with many crossed wings. They appeared
in groups and halos surrounding the presence of the Father, the Son, or
the Virgin. The cherubs or <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">putti</i> of later Italian art, so frequently seen
with the Madonna and Child, are the artistic descendants of the Seraphim
and Cherubim. They are seen in the large aureoles of light that surround
the Madonna; for instance, in Raphael's "Sistine Madonna" and Titian's
"Assumption of the Virgin." They recede into the background or come
forward in clouds as the countless hosts of heaven.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus03.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DOMENICHINO. MADONNA OF THE ROSARY (detail)</p>
</div>

<p>Frequently the Cherubs are given enlarged childlike or feminine forms
with individual features, elongated wings, variegated colors. They are
then shown hovering or standing or seated near the Madonna, and are
usually playing on musical instruments&mdash;making music for the glory of the
Madonna and Child. They are seen in the pictures of Bellini (bel-lee´-nee)
and Carpaccio (kahr-pah´-cho) near the foot of the throne; with Melozzo
da Forlì (for-lee´) they soar in the air; with Duccio (doo´-cho) and Cimabue
(chee-mah-boo´-ah) they stand about the throne, dressed in rich
robes, singing, playing, or worshiping. Music and color were associated
in the minds of
the early Italians as
though both were manifestations
of sentiment
in art. Especially
was this true at Venice,&mdash;the
one great color
spot in Italian art.</p>




<h3 class="gesperrt">MINISTERING AND GUARDIAN ANGELS</h3>

<p>The angels that
sang the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria in Excelsis</i>,
or knelt near at
hand at the birth of
Christ, were usually
larger than the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">putti</i>,
girlish in form, and
very beautiful of face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
They were dressed sometimes in colors, as with Correggio (kor-red´-jo);
sometimes in gold brocades of gorgeous pattern, as with the Vivarini (vee-vahr-ee´-nee);
sometimes in white and blue, as with Piero della Françesca
(frahn-ches´-kah). Again, they frequently had jeweled crowns or embossed
halos or peacock-eyed wings. It was the idea of the old masters to make them
decoratively beautiful as well as representative of purity and truth. And
they carried out this idea still further in the faces, which were always of the
most lovely types they could find or imagine. To us today these angel faces
are perhaps the most attractive feature of this early church art of Italy.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus04b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CORREGGIO; ANGEL GROUP (detail of fresco at Parma)</p>
</div>

<p>The same kind of angels, but clothed usually in white, appeared to the
Shepherds, attended the Holy Family in their flight into Egypt, stood by
the river bank at the baptism of Christ, were with Him in the wilderness,
in the garden, at the crucifixion, watched by the tomb, and rolled away
the stone from the door. Others of the angelic host appeared at times
to warn Abraham, to present a message to Saint Joachim, to guide Saint
Peter out of his prison. They were all ministering spirits, but without
specific names.</p>

<p class="caption">FRA BARTOLOMMEO; MADONNA ENTHRONED (detail)</p>
</div>



<h3 class="gesperrt">THE SEVEN ARCHANGELS</h3>

<p>On the other hand, certain
deeds to be done were given to
certain angels who had definite
names. These were the seven archangels.
It was Michael, captain of
the Hosts of Heaven, that overcame
the Demon and drove him into the
Bottomless Pit; it was Jophiel with
the flaming sword that drove Adam
and Eve out of Paradise; it was
Zadkiel that stayed the hand of
Abraham, and Chamuel that wrestled
with Jacob. These were all archangels
who appeared with their various
symbols in Christian art. Uriel,
guardian of the sun, is seen less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
frequently than the others; but
Raphael, the chief guardian
angel, is often seen in company
with Tobit, and occasionally in
the pictures of the Last Judgment
with Michael, blowing the
dread blast of the great resurrection.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus05a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GUIDO RENI: ST. MICHAEL AND THE DEMON</p>
</div>

<p>But the angel Gabriel appears
in art oftener than all the
other angels put together. This
is because he was the angel of
the Annunciation and foretold
the coming of Christ. He is seen
a thousand times in Italian art,
lilies in hand, kneeling and repeating
the message to the Madonna.
The theme was the most
popular of all, and a thousand
different types of beauty were
created to impersonate Gabriel.
Many of them are still existent,
and some of them are the
most lovely creations of the old
masters.</p>


<h3 class="gesperrt">ANGEL IDEALS OF THE OLD MASTERS</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus05b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VEROCCHIO (School of) ARCHANGEL RAPHAEL (detail)</p>
</div>

<p>Of course the ideal of angelic beauty varied with each painter. Each
chose for a model the fairest type he could find,
and each differed from his fellow. Perhaps
the most popular types of angels in the early
Renaissance were painted by Melozzo da Forlì.
A notable group of them was painted in a
cupola of the Church of the Apostles in Rome.
They were angels of the Ascension, and surrounded
the rising figure of Christ. The fresco
afterward became so damaged that it was
taken down, and some of the angels were
transferred to the Sacristy of St. Peter's,
where they are now to be seen. Our reproduction
shows a detail of one of them,&mdash;one with
a fair face, abundant hair, a halo about the
head made up of golden cubes of mosaic, and
large expanded wings. The figure is seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
slightly foreshortened, and this, with
the spread wings that seem really
large enough to support an angel,
gives the impression of flight, or at
least a hovering movement. The
wings are upraised, and seem to
frame the beautiful head and its
halo. This upward swing of the
wings is counterbalanced by the
downward sweep of the drapery
from the waist line. Between the
upward and the downward curves is
a swirling cross line, made up by the
shoulder, the arm, and the violin
bow. All this is shrewdly worked
out, and gives force and movement
to the figure. The whole composition
has nobility and loftiness
about it, and is not a mere sweet-faced
affair of the Carlo Dolci
(dol´-chee) kind.</p>

<h3 class="gesperrt">TYPES OF BENOZZO AND LEONARDO DA VINCI</h3>

<p>The angels of Benozzo Gozzoli (got´-so-lee) are of similar characters.
They have not a particle of sweetness about them, and would never be
called "pretty"; but what fine sentiment and decided individuality they
have! They are part of a famous fresco in the Riccardi Palace at Florence,
one of the finest and best preserved frescos in all Italy. The little
chapel where they are had its walls entirely covered by Benozzo with a
fresco representing the Adoration of the Kings. The gorgeous procession
of the kings and their attendants (made up of portraits of the Medici and
their friends, with Lorenzo the Magnificent riding as one of the kings)
covers three walls of the chapel. The splendid cavalcade winds along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and finally comes up to the fourth wall, where was once shown the
Madonna and Child with Joseph. This group of the Holy Family has
disappeared; but the band of worshiping angels is on the side wall, still
intact. The angels are kneeling and standing amid flowers which one
does not see at first because of the bright colors and the golden halos.
What beautiful faces, naïve forms, and praying hands are here! This is
sincerity in art, and true enough sentiment into the bargain. One will
travel far before seeing its better.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus07.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BOTTICINI: MADONNA AND CHILD (detail of angels)</p>
</div>

<p>A historic and even a sentimental interest attaches to Leonardo da
Vinci's (lay-o-nahrd´-o dah vin´-chee) little angel in the Baptism of Christ
by Andrea Verocchio (vay-rok´-kee-o). Vasari (vah-sah´-ree) recites the
story of how Verocchio, when ill perhaps, told his pupil, the young Leonardo,
to finish this picture by painting in the second angel, and that
Leonardo did it so well that it was superior to the other parts of the picture.
"Perceiving this, Andrea resolved never again to take pencil in
hand; since Leonardo, though still so young, had acquitted himself better
in the art than he had done." This is a pretty story, which has been pooh-poohed
and denied by recent criticism, but without reason. The angel
with the profile was certainly done by a different hand than the angel with
the full face. It is different from any other part of the picture, and there
is every reason to believe it done by Leonardo as Vasari states. The
charm of the angel, the type,
the graceful contours, the light
and shade, all foreshadow the
later work of Leonardo. What
a lovely creation, not only in
face and feature, but in serenity
and fine feeling!</p>


<h3 class="gesperrt">THE CHARMING
ANGELS OF PERUGINO</h3>

<p>Perugino (pay-roo-jee´-no)
was in that same studio of
Verocchio, a fellow pupil with
Leonardo; but his angels are
much weaker conceptions than
Leonardo's. They are contemplative,
full of wistful tenderness,
lost in reverie; but they lack
somewhat in mental grip. They
make up for this, however, by a
charming sentiment. The St.
Michael, reproduced herewith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
shows it. He is hardly the ideal
captain-general of the heavenly host,
able to wield the sword in the front
ranks; but on the contrary is a slight,
boyish figure, full of fancy, and lost
in day dreams.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 145px;">
<img src="images/illus08b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FRA ANGELICO: TRUMPET-BLOWING ANGEL</p>
</div>

<h3 class="gesperrt">PERUGINO'S SAINT MICHAEL</h3>

<p>In this picture he stands aloof
from the figures about him, and, with
his head inclined to one side, seems
to be listening to the song of the angels
in the upper air. The brown eyes
are full of earnestness; but the round
face and slight mouth have no set purpose
other than to suggest sentiment
and symmetry.
A very
pretty type,
no doubt; but
not a strong
one. A man of
power like Michelangelo could have very little
sympathy with it. Indeed, he sneered at the
pretty face and called Perugino a dolt and blockhead
in art. That was more than Perugino could
bear, and, in a rage, he brought Michelangelo
before the Council of Eight on a charge of slander.
But it only resulted in a laugh at Perugino's expense.
His action was perhaps foolish; but his
pictures are not to be laughed at. They are excellent
in color, and the pretty face that Michelangelo
scorned became the early model for Perugino's
great pupil, Raphael.</p>

<div class="figright" style="height: 320px;">
<img src="images/illus08a.jpg"  alt="" />
<p class="caption">FRA ANGELICO: CORONATION (detail)</p>
</div>


<p>In sweetness of type and depth of feeling,
the angels of Fra Angelico are more profound than
Perugino's. Besides, they seem to have more sincerity
about them. The monk-painter in his cell
saw visions of heavenly things, and as he saw so
he recorded in art. All his faces seem filled with
divine tenderness. He painted only one face, one
type. His pictures show men with beards and monks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in cowls, and angels in flowing robes with bright
wings; but there is always the same face, the
same sentiment. His trumpet-blowing angels,
of which there are countless copies in existence,
are epitomes of this conception and sentiment.
They have great purity and beauty. Fra Angelico
was a man of pure thought to start with,
and everything he touched reflected his purity.</p>

<p class="caption">SEPPI; ANGEL OF ANNUNCIATION</p>
</div>

<p>Filippino and Botticelli came later than
Fra Angelico, and the Florence of their day
had begun to draw away from medieval traditions
in art in favor of more learned technical
accomplishment; yet one can hardly see any
waning of sentiment in the work of these men.
In fact, the sentiment of Filippino is often perilously
near to sentimentality, so intense and
earnest is the feeling of the man. His Madonna
is always on the brink of tears, and his angels
are in perfect sympathy with the Madonna.
Botticelli is more of an intellectual force; but
he too is saturated
with
sentiment to a point of morbidity. His
Madonnas have sad eyes, mouths that
droop at the corners, hollow cheeks,
and long, flowing hair. They bend before
the Angel of the Annunciation like
broken flowers, or agonize at the Crucifixion
like lost souls. Their sentiment
is intense. Nor does it vary much when
Botticelli dealt with classic subjects.
His Venus in her seashell, his Pallas, his
Spring, all have some of the same morbidity,
mingled with mystery, melancholy,
tenderness, that we see in his
angels surrounding the Madonna. This
personal quality of the painter is very
attractive, and has perhaps done more
to make Botticelli popular than his fine
qualities as a draftsman and a painter.</p>

<h3 class="gesperrt">PRERAPHAELITE ANGELS</h3>

<p>When the Preraphaelite movement started in England over half
a century ago, with Rossetti, Holman-Hunt, and Millais as painters,
and Ruskin for a prophet, it could think of no one better as a model
to follow than Botticelli. The Botticelli look is quite apparent in the
sad, rather unhealthy faces of Rossetti.
This Rossetti influence was handed on to
his pupil, Burne-Jones. None of the Preraphaelite
ardor was abated or its sentiment
lessened with Burne-Jones. Indeed,
he improved upon his master both technically
and sentimentally. He was a much
better draftsman and colorist than Rossetti,
and presented the Preraphaelite idea
with greater force and effect.</p>

<img src="images/illus11a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VEROCCHIO: BAPTISM (detail of Leonardo's Angel)</p>
</div>

<p>The Burne-Jones type had rounder,
more inquiring eyes, thinner cheeks, a
sadder mouth, a more willowy figure. It
appears often in long, flowing hair, with
swirling drapery, and dramatic action. At
other times one sees it as a romantic
type consumed by a fever of passionate
sentiment. The Annunciation shown herewith
is not a very good illustration of
this. The Madonna has a dull stare in
her eyes as though she was something of
an invalid, and even the angel has a semi-malarious
look. But the melancholy, the
sadness, the morbidity, so apparent in Botticelli
are also apparent here. The picture
is a fine example of the painter's decorative
sense. It has been put together with
much skill. Notice the architecture, the
passageway at back, the bas reliefs, the
repeated lines of the draperies in both the
Madonna and the angel. One could almost wish it in stained glass,
so beautifully would it fill an upright window.</p>


<p>Every painter of Botticelli's rank in Italy had a score or less
of followers, and among them all there was never any dearth of
sentimental Madonnas and pathetic angels. Florence held no monopoly
of the subject.</p>

<h3 class="gesperrt">ANGELS OF BELLINI AND
CARPACCIO</h3>



<p>At Venice in the early days
were Bellini and Carpaccio, who
produced famous Madonnas and
most lovable angels. They are
different angels from those of
Botticelli. In fact, they are little
more than handsome children
naïvely making music for the
Madonna and Child. Their unconscious
quality is captivating.
How very childlike, in their pure
faces, their golden hair, their
round legs and fat little hands!
The models were perhaps the
painter's own children. Why not?
Was not the Madonna, nine
times out of ten, the painter's own
wife? And how better could he depict
the winged messengers of the
sky than by painting them with the
forms of those he loved here below?
It is only a step across the
world from heaven to earth, and is
not love the band that unites them?</p>

</div>

<p>We have just received the following letter
from a reader of The Mentor: "I
have examined with great care and profit
a copy of The Mentor just received. There
is only one suggestion that I can make
towards its improvement, and that is that
on the back of the photogravures there
should be a pronunciation scheme for all
foreign names. Not everyone who reads
is able to pronounce properly the Spanish,
French, or Italian; particularly is this
true of names and places. The pronunciation
might be put in brackets right after
the names, or made a sort of marginal
affair."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/stars.jpg" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>This is the kind of letter we like to get.
The suggestion is a good one. We wrote
at once to the writer, saying that pronunciation
would be indicated wherever
foreign names were used. We have done
so in the text pages of The Mentor&mdash;our
readers know that. We have not
been doing it in the stories printed on the
back of The Mentor gravures. There was
no reason for not doing it. The indication
of pronunciations should accompany foreign
names wherever they are used. The
writer of the above has done us a real
service in calling attention to the matter.
We wish that readers would write to us
whenever they have a suggestion that they
think would add to the value and usefulness
of The Mentor.</p>

</div>

<p>Half knowledge on any subject is not
of much use. The case of a college professor
comes to mind. He was very strong
on what he called "completing a thought
and finishing a fact." He said that as a
man walked through life or looked through
books he was constantly in an atmosphere
of information&mdash;that facts were
darting like meteors all about him. He said
that the habit of mind of most people was
slovenly. Such complete facts as come
to their attention are perhaps absorbed.
Half facts come along, and most people do
not "follow them up to a finish." The
habit of this professor was to carry a
memorandum pad in his pocket, and whenever
he would hear a statement or receive
a <em>bit</em> of knowledge he would jot down
a note and then, in some leisure moment,
look the matter up in an authoritative
reference book, thereby completing his information
and, as he put it, "sewing it up
good and tight" for future use.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/stars.jpg" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>The result is that that college professor
knows what he knows thoroughly and
accurately. He is never heard saying, as
so many do when a subject is mentioned,
"Oh, what about that. I have had bits of
information concerning it from time to
time. What does it mean?" The professor
had looked up the matter when he
got his first bit of information, and, as a
result, he had digested the subject and in
his way owned it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/stars.jpg" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>We have planned The Mentor with the
thought of giving members of the Association
the essential information that they
should have on different subjects. Everyone
is not fortunate enough to have a good
reference library&mdash;some are not even in
touch with reference books. It is the
purpose of The Mentor, therefore, to
come like a good friend who is well informed
and spend a few minutes a day
with you, telling you in simple language
about the many interesting and important
things, events, and people of the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/stars.jpg" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>And you don't have to make notes as
the professor did. You don't have to go
looking for books of reference on the subject.
The Mentor not only gives you in
an interesting way the essential facts about
a thing, together with illustrations, but it
gives you a list of the important reference
books on the subject.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Today</span> we think of Italy as one united country. For
that reason it is difficult for many of us to realize
the Italy of Melozzo da Forlì's (mel-ot´-so day for-lee´)
time. Then there was no union&mdash;practically no
Italy. The country was rent by the strivings of many tiny
principalities, each jealous of the other, each trying to outdo
the other, each quick to seize an opportunity
to work its neighbor harm.</p>

<p>Every one of the petty princes was seeking
to beautify his capital city, to have his
court outshine those of his rivals. If he
desired to be known as a patron of art and
letters, poets, architects, and philosophers
were invited to associate themselves with
him. Artists, like the scholars, had to
rely on the favor of such princes for their
living.</p>

<p>In later years the introduction of oil
painting made easy the sending of a panel
or a canvas as the gift of one lord to another.
But before that time, instead of
sending the painter's work, it would have
been necessary to send the painter; for
most of the work was done in another way.
In fresco painting the artist was obliged
to work directly on the wall on which the
picture was to be seen when finished.
Often he himself applied the wet plaster,
and after smoothing it laid on the color.
He had to work rapidly; for when the plaster
had dried every addition or correction
showed.</p>

<p>But before becoming sufficiently generous
to give away their artist's work most
of the nobles first employed their artists to
decorate their own chapels or palaces for
them. It was under the patronage of one
of the cardinals, a nephew of Pope Pius IV,
that Melozzo da Forlì painted his angels.
Pius IV did not wish to be behind his
neighbors in the encouragement of the fine
arts. He wanted Rome to be the finest
city in the world, and set about making it
so. Those who wished to please him were
not slow to follow his leading.</p>

<p>The angels reproduced in The Mentor
are but a portion of the entire fresco,
which showed the Ascension of Christ, and
formerly decorated the dome of the Church
of the Apostles at Rome. These fragments
escaped destruction when the church was
reconstructed in 1711. They are now in
the Sacristy of Saint Peter's.</p>

<p>Almost nothing is known of the life of
Melozzo. We should not have known
when he was born if his epitaph had not
recorded his age. His name indicates that
he came from Forlì, a small town not far
from Ravenna. His fame rests almost
entirely on these fragments; but so well
were they done that they give this man
high rank among the artists of Italy.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Like</span> many another painter, Benozzo Gozzoli (beñ-ot´-so
got´-so-lee) owed much to his master. Fra
Angelico painted beautiful angels, and his pupil
seems to have learned some of his skill; for the group
of Adoring Angels in the Riccardi Palace is one of the loveliest
to be seen in all Italy. Early in his life Benozzo was apprenticed
to Ghiberti, the sculptor of the doors
of the baptistery at Florence. So splendid
are they that by the Italians they are called
"The Doors of Paradise." He began under
a good man. But he could not have remained
in that studio long; for at the age
of twenty-seven we find Fra Angelico taking
him with him to Rome as assistant in
his work for the Pope.</p>

<p>Two years later Benozzo started out for
himself. He worked in several of the
smaller Tuscan towns, until in 1459 the
death of several of the older artists of
Florence opened up the way for his return
to his native city.</p>

<p>He was not obliged to wait long; for the
Medici soon called upon him for what
proved to be his masterpiece. The palace
of the Medici had in it a small private
chapel; to Benozzo they gave the task of
decorating its walls. The subject chosen
was "The Adoration of the Magi." We
have three letters written by Benozzo to
Piero de' Medici when he was engaged
upon this work. They show that he was
using every effort to do his best. "I have
no other thought in my heart," he writes,
"but how best to perfect my work and satisfy
your wishes."</p>

<p>The work was well done. Perhaps that
is why everyone who today visits Florence
feels that he must see this tiny chapel before
he leaves. One steps from the busy
Florentine street, through massive portals,
into a courtyard. From the present we
step back into the past. Climbing a stair,
we reach the dim chapel, which is but little
changed from the way it was left by Benozzo.
It is as much a monument of his
skill as it is of the munificence of the Medici.</p>

<p>Benozzo's success with this work insured
his prosperity. He married and settled in
Florence. Ten years later he moved to
Pisa, where he spent sixteen years painting
a series of frescos in the Campo Santo.
And in that lovely, quiet place he lies
buried today, near the frescos upon which
he labored so faithfully.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> mother of Sir Edward Burne-Jones died when he
was born. The lot of a lad without a mother is
bound to be a hard one, especially if he has no
brothers or sisters. His father would permit him to
read only two or three books; but one of them was Æsop's
Fables, and this was the boy's favorite, because it had prints
in it. The child used to spend much time
before the shop windows looking at the
volumes he might not read. He was never
very strong physically.</p>

<p>This course seems to have driven the
boy to living in the realms of the imagination,&mdash;a
training for the painter of nymphs
and fairies he was to become later. Not
until he was twenty-three, it is said, did
Burne-Jones see a good picture.</p>

<p>When he went up to Oxford he formed
a friendship with William Morris, a youth
almost as shy as himself. They read Ruskin's
"Modern Painters" together, and
told each other their dreams. At London
during one of the vacations he came into
touch with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and
on advice of this artist gave up his studies
at Oxford to devote himself exclusively to
the study of art. However frail Burne-Jones
may have been physically, there
could have been no lack of mental courage
in the man who could take such a bold
step as this.</p>

<p>His struggle was a long one and a hard
one; but he was never without the help
and encouragement of warm friends, Ruskin
among them. He traveled to Italy.
On his second trip he went with Ruskin.
But with the possible exception of Botticelli,
the Italian masters had little direct
influence upon his work. He seems to have
caught their spirit of doing things, of doing
them as well as he was able, with deep
sincerity of feeling.</p>

<p>He was one of the leading spirits of the
Preraphaelites, a band of young men who
hoped to regenerate art by putting into
their work the simplicity and sincerity that
had actuated the artists before Raphael's
time.</p>

<p>He married in 1860, and settled on the
outskirts of London. A gradually increasing
host of friends began to make
their way to his modest home. Burne-Jones
felt that, wherever else he might be
at fault, in spirit he was right. So he did
not reach for the fame that makes less wise
men seek short cuts, but worked steadily
and carefully. His reputation increased,
honors came to him, and before he died he
knew that his work was being appreciated.</p>

<p>In 1894, four years before his death, a
baronetcy was conferred upon him by
Queen Victoria, and to those who knew
the man and his work this was felt to be
not higher than was deserved.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Bellini (bel-lee´-nee) family was a very artistic one.
Not only Giovanni, but his brother Gentile as well,
became a famous artist, and their father was a
painter of note. Not to be outdone by the other
members of the family, their only sister Andrea married Mantegna,
the great Paduan master. Under such circumstances it
is unlikely that the boy Giovanni had to
overcome any parental opposition to his
becoming an artist. Art must have been
a part of the daily life of the entire family.
At first he doubtless studied under his
father's direction; but his early work
shows that he was much influenced by his
brother-in-law as well.</p>

<p>Although the two brothers, Giovanni
and Gentile, worked independently, they
both won distinction and were highly esteemed
by the Venetians. They were
commissioned to paint a series of large
canvases for the Ducal Palace; but these
works have since been destroyed by two
fires which greatly damaged that wonderful
building,&mdash;the first in 1479 and the second
in 1577.</p>

<p>Although no longer a young man when
the invention of oil painting was first
brought to Venice, instead of adhering to
the old traditions he set about mastering
the new medium. And he succeeded too.
Pupils came to him to be taught the new
practice; among them Titian and Giorgione.
His studio was the very dwelling
place of the Genius of Painting, and from
his workshop went out many of the men
to whom Venetian painting owes its fame.</p>

<p>Painters from far and near came to visit
him. Among them was Albrecht Dürer,
the German master, whom Bellini received
very cordially. "He is very old," wrote
Dürer, "but still the best in painting."
There was a waiting list of nobles who
wanted him to paint their portraits.</p>

<p>Fine in color, and accurate in drawing
to the last, he seems not to have degenerated.
He must have been a man of great
force and talent.</p>

<p>He lived to be ninety years old. He was
laid to rest beside his brother, in San Giovanni
e Paolo, the Westminster Abbey of
Venice.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Venice</span> the Magnificent is never very far removed
from the pictures of Vittore Carpaccio (kahr-pah´-cho).
It doesn't matter whether he is painting the
story of Saint Ursula at Cologne or a scene from
Holy Writ, Cologne is given a very Venetian look, and the
Madonna or the Saints are in Venetian costumes and brocades.</p>

<p>This oriental love for splendor in dress
has led some writers to believe that Carpaccio
must have accompanied his master
Gentile Bellini to Constantinople. When
the sultan desired that Venice send one of
her foremost artists to paint his portrait,
the commission was given to Gentile Bellini.
He may have taken Carpaccio with
him. The portrait Bellini painted exists
today in the Layard collection, recently
bequeathed to the National Gallery, London.</p>

<p>Although Carpaccio painted many religious
pictures, he succeeded best when
there was some story to be told. He gave
to his pictures the charming simplicity that
is the first essential of a good story-teller.
Nor was he without a sense of humor. In
one of his pictures telling the story of the
life of Saint Jerome he shows the lion walking
up to Jerome and holding out his paw
in order that the troublesome thorn might
be removed, while the terrified brothers of
the saint are seen flying in all directions.</p>

<p>One of the Venetian nobles gave Carpaccio
a commission to paint the portrait
of a poet connected with his household. At
least one of these rhymesters was to be
found in the train of most of the nobles
in those times. The poet was so elated
that he burst forth into verse, giving Carpaccio
directions to paint him with a
wreath of laurel. Carpaccio painted the
portrait; but, possibly at a hint from the
nobleman, he substituted for the crown of
laurel one of grape leaves. The poet retaliated
by reviling Carpaccio in a lampoon
full of abuse.</p>

<p>We do not know exactly when Carpaccio
was born, though it is generally believed
to have been in 1450, in Istria, nor just
when he died. Only at Venice can an adequate
conception of his work be formed.
He seems never to have journeyed far
from that island city.</p>

<p>Carpaccio's love for splendor found
plenty of employment among the beauty-loving
Venetians. Venice was beyond the
reach of papal dictation, and religion came
to be considered by them more as an opportunity
for display than as a rule of conduct.
Its tragic phases were not at all
popular. The Crucifixion was not often
painted; but the Presentation in the Temple
and the Feast in the House of Simon,
with their display of fine costumes, were
painted again and again.</p>

<p>When Ruskin first went to Venice, Carpaccio's
work was not at all appreciated;
but, thanks to his lead in admiring its
charming qualities, today Carpaccio is
loved by many.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Perugino</span> (pay-roo-jee´-no) was born in 1446 in a
little town not far from Perugia. His parents were
respectable people, and when he was nine years old
they sent him to Perugia to be educated under one
of the artists of that city. His family name was Vannucci; but
like many other Italian artists he was called after the city from
which he came. He grew up in Perugia;
but by the time he had reached early manhood
we find him at Florence, studying the
frescos. According to Vasari, he became a
pupil of Verocchio, and in Verocchio's studio
worked side by side with Leonardo da
Vinci.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the change
from tempera to oil painting took place in
Italy. Perugino and Leonardo were
among the first of the artists who thoroughly
mastered the new medium.</p>

<p>Perugino's careful work did much to increase
his fame. Before he had reached
the age of forty he was invited by the Pope
to come to Rome. He painted several subjects
for the Sistine Chapel, and his work
was given a prominent place in that place.
But when a later pope wished to make
room for Michelangelo's "Last Judgment"
Perugino's frescos were ruthlessly destroyed
and the space they had occupied
was filled with Michelangelo's huge composition.</p>

<p>Judging from his quiet, pensive Madonnas
and his melancholy Saints, it might be
thought that Perugino was of a saintly
character too; but the records of Florence
show that after his return from Rome he
and a companion got into difficulties with
the authorities. They were captured when
lying in wait for someone against whom
they had a grudge. Perugino escaped
with a fine of ten florins after pleading
that he had intended that the fellow should
have no more than a good drubbing; but
his companion, who harbored graver designs,
was exiled.</p>

<p>Perugino's work arose steadily in public
esteem. Commissions came rapidly, and
he was able to choose among them. A number
of the younger men came to him to be
taught his method. Among them was the
young Raphael, who worked with him for
several years. Raphael's early work much
resembles Perugino's.</p>

<p>Perugino married a beautiful girl many
years his junior. He never tired of dressing
her in rich costumes. But as he grew
older he also grew miserly. When he died
he left a comfortable estate for her and her
three sons. He was carried off by the
plague when working in one of the towns
not far from Florence, at the age of seventy-eight
years.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
